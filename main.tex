\title{Sharing is Caring: Shared Libraries for an Embedded Operating System}

\section*{Abstract}

Today, shared libraries are ubiquitous in modern operating systems. %
When multiple processes share the same code, memory can be saved by removing any duplicate copies of the libraries they have in common. %
This technique becomes increasingly relevant in the context of multi-tenant embedded systems. %
These devices are already resource constrained, however, this problem is exacerbated with the presence of multiple ”apps” running on the same system. %
This presents an opportunity to free the system to do even more with its precious resources or to push the same workloads to cheaper devices. %
This work examines the design and implementation of adding shared libraries to a multi-tenant embedded operating system with a focus on system security and efficiency. %

\section*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the problem?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Wasted space
        \end{itemize}
    \item Why is this an important problem?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Limited memory on embedded systems. (Reference Hudson paper)
            \item Wireless app flashing and loading
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Background}

\section*{Related Works}

\begin{itemize}
    \item TODO: see what kind of support other embedded OSes have for shared libraries have. how are they implemented? any drawbacks?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Overview}

\section*{Design}

\begin{itemize}
    \item security? prevent one app from messing with shared library memory which would affect another app (use MPU to make shared memory sections r/x only, no writes?)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{Discussion}

\section*{Conclusion}
